										<h2 class="major">The Last Leg Legend</h2>
										<p>Channel 4's very own Last Leg (which hopefully get renewed for another series soon) is Alex's main passion project, in where its the only show where the "weird-looking one with glasses" in the trio, is the only one who gets asked if he is disabled. While Adam and Alex are literally on their Last Legs, and Josh is on his last leg in ticket sales, it's fair to say that this whole section on this site, is just dedicated to bullying Josh. Let's see if this makes it on the show next week, huh?</p>

										<h2 class="major">restraining order needed.</h2>
										<p>Such a fan of musical boybands and garage artists, you can put your faith in Alex when he is literally stuck in 2002. It's by miricle he hasn't fangirled over male artists, and preferred them over his wife, (you will never live down that All Star Mr & Mrs episode). If he hasn't mentioned it to you in the first 5 seconds of meeting him, He loves Craig David, Backstreet Boys and Justin Timberlake. Alex is a teenage girl in the early 2000's in terms of music taste. Don't expect much else.</p>

										<h2 class="major">lads lads lads</h2>
										<p>Alex Brooker is alot like one of the "lads" and enjoys afew games of football. Mess with his season ticket, and he will actually think his life is forever over. Like life has just collapsed. The lad, also, gets way too excited at any thought or mention of anything Ghostbusters. Seriously.</p>
